# Discord Scheduler Bot

Scheduling meetups is a pain and when2meet sucks so I made this bot :) <br>
To use, replace the token with your own and id with the server id, then run `schedule.py`.

## Commands
1. `/start` to start an event, users can select the earliest and latest starting time for the following two weeks.
2. `/summary` to view all events and response counts.
3. `/schedule` to find a date and time with the most number of participants.
